# Google-Form-Auto-Counter
Made for the Service Station of Austin College. 
Great Day of Service is one of the big events we run that connects students to 40+ volunteer sites in Texoma area, and a problem we encountered was keeping track of participants in each volunteer site.

This form counter allows forms to close as soon as X participants is reached, allowing for easier processesing of volunteers.
